RPM Display System for BLDC Motor (8051 Microcontroller, Embedded C)
Designed and built a microcontroller-based system to measure and control the RPM of a BLDC motor with real-time display.
Developed a 3-phase project: input (speed set via switches), processing (IR sensor with 8051 microcontroller), and output (PWM motor control and LCD display).
Utilized IR speed sensor to measure RPM and generated accurate PWM signals to regulate motor speed.
Integrated electronic components including resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes, crystal oscillator, and MOSFETs for circuit design.
Displayed real-time RPM on a 16x2 LCD using Embedded C programming.
Demonstrated strong understanding of circuit design, microcontroller interfacing, and embedded systems development.
